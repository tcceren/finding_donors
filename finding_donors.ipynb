    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "# **Answer: **\n",
    "1) Gaussian Naive Bayes: \n",
    "a) Model is widely used in spam e mail detection. b) It's a very simple yet  efficient, fast and scalable model, it works good with numerical, categorical data.  c)It's naive so it accepts that all the predictors are irrelevant to each other. It can not detect the relation among features. d) I'd like to use Naive Bayes for this problem because of its efficiency and its ability to produce a result very fast. And also we have a lot of categorical data here in which naive bayes might  work well. \n",

    "http://dataaspirant.com/2017/02/06/naive-bayes-classifier-machine-learning/ \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Decision Trees: a) Decision trees can be applied to churn models for telco companies, trying to find out if a subscriber will stop his contract given his features (income, minutes of usages, number of call center calls, etc). b) One primary advantage of decision trees is the model is readable therefore it is very easy to gain insights on features and convey it to the non technical people or management.And a decision tree can help us weigh the likely consequences of one decision against another. In some cases, it can even help us estimate expected payoffs of decisions. c) Decision trees have high variance and unstability. Because of its greedy search strategy, its search of finding the right starting point can impact the results dramatically. Different data will result in very different outcomes. Decision Tree's do not work best if we have a lot of un-correlated variables. It also tends to overfit in case the tree depth is increased.    d)The insight here might be hidden in \"small pockets\" or mini clusters .Therefore using decision trees might make sense here discovering these hidden mini clusters containing >50K making people.  \n",

    "\n",
    "3) SVM: a) SVM has been used successfully in many real-world problems like text categorization, bioinformatics (protein / cancer classification) or image classification. It's a relatively new technique. b) It works well with datasets when the data is not easily linearly seperable, meaning when the data is too hard. It maps the data to a higher dimensional space, that leads to solution of very hard questions. c) It's relatively sensible to noise. This means if there's an outlier or a wrongly labeled data in the dataset, then the performance might decrease dramatically. d) I'd like to use this model for our dataset in case the data is hard, meaning can not be easily seperable / predictable by more traditional methods like the first two methods of ours.\n",

    "\n",
    "We are asked for 3 models but if that was 4 I'd go with logistic regression:\n",
    "4) Logistic Regression a) Logistic regression is used in image segmentation, categorization or handwriting recognition in real life.It's a great way to answer questions like:\"How does the probability of getting lung cancer (yes vs. no) change for every additional pound a person is overweight and for every pack of cigarettes smoked per day?\"  b)Logistic regression is very simple,also fast, it has low variance and so is NOT prone to over-fitting. It will perform better if there's a single decision boundary.It's the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary). c) Opposite to stated in b, it is not flexibe enough to capture complex relationships. This leads to underperforming when there are multiple non linear decision boundaries. d) I'd try logistic regression, because if there's a very obvious decision boundary lying beneath the data, the logistic regression would capture it.\n",

Considering the accuracy score of testing set, the SVM slightly beats the decision tree on full data set, however its training time is at least 100 times slower than the decision tree, which a big disadvantage in real life. Not only accuracy is important, but also the f-score is also very important, in which the SVM again slightly beats decision tree considering the full training data set, but again, the decision tree performs almost the same with SVM. Therefore, because of its performance on training and prediction times and its decent accuracy and fscore results, we choose to continue with decision tree model.\n"

    "**Answer: ** Here, we have a problem of finding whether an individual makes more than 50K or less, based on their information like their education, their capital gain or loss, their age , marital status, their native country and their occupation, etc. To predict the income of the individuals most efficiently, we are going to use a technich called decision tree, which is widely used in categorization problems like, \"if a telco subscriber will end his contract or not, based on his usage, his number of call centers calls, etc.\" Our problem here is not much different than that here.So we're first going to learn from the data we have, which is called the training process. \n",

And then we ask a question (pick an another attribute) and try to seperate the individuals again. This will continue until we have an answer (individual earns more than 50K or less than 50K). After completing the training process, we will have a tree which will work like a guideline, a map. Depending on it we will be able to make a decision in every part of tree and following a path will lead to a decision. This is how we will predict new individuals' income levels (prediction process).\n",

We also take the errors (mistakenly classified as over 50K even though they are not or vice versa) into account and calculate a score for that. Our prediction had a score of 0.62, with a scale between 0 and 1, meaning 0 is worst and 1 is too good to be true. "

    "**Answer:** My 4 important ranked features showed up among the model's important features here, even though their orders came with a surprise. I thought occupation should be 3rd  important feature, though it couldn't make even in the top 5 important feature. Capital loss seems more important than capital gain, which is again surprising for me, also age being second important. Also, hours-per-week proved that it is more important than I thought. Besides these, I thought education should be important, and the model verified that idea."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**  The model trained with only 5 feature instead of 100 produced excellent results! The accuracy is only 2 points lower! There's a performance decrease on the F-Score, however if training time was a factor for me, I'd definitely go with the reduced data. In real world applications, we might need to deal with millions of rows and the decision makers might expect our application to produce accurate results within seconds. So, yes, I'd consider using this reduced data and also this question really made a perfect point! Thanks! "
